Title: Activities

Left: Design for Wellbeing will last 12 months starting in march 2017. The proposed project’s methodology is distinctive. Some people and especially musicians have already in their inner self some knowledge to face positively stressful life challenges.

----

Right: This research provides an opportunity to light up those competences and make them shareable activating a self-learning mechanism. Following a bottom-up research method combined with participatory design, techniques and best practices will be identified, organized and incorporated into an easily-accessible Open Access Toolkit. The Toolkit will be refined, developed and tested in different learning contexts.

Phases: 

- 
  title: Phase 1
  name: User Research
  text: >
    The data collection and analysis will
    profit from the partner project Musical
    Impact (RCM) and the previous studies on
    performers’ stress management leaded
    by the partners institutions. These
    roots are combined with ethnographic
    research involving professionals as well
    as students.
- 
  title: Phase 2
  name: Analysis
  text: >
    Collected perspectives of strategies,
    behavioural and physical activities will
    be mapped and addressed in strategy
    patterns to define user needs and the
    Toolkit framework.
- 
  title: Phase 3
  name: Design and Modelling
  text: >
    A first version of the toolkit will be
    developed in a low tech prototype
    through participatory design activities
    with students and designer. This phase
    drives the refinement of experiential
    specifications that create the basis for
    the definition of a dynamic toolkit.
- 
  title: Phase 4
  name: Open Access Toolkit dev.
  text: >
    The low-fidelity prototype of the
    Toolkit will be tested and evaluated
    with volunteer professional performers,
    students and teachers from music and
    theatre schools. The digital version of
    the Tool will then developed and
    implemented. During this phase the
    toolkit will be open to different
    educational contexts.
- 
  title: Phase 5
  name: Exploration
  text: >
    The Exploration phase consists of a
    Future Scenario design workshop in which
    the toolkit will be enhanced and
    extended into the technology realm
    through a co-creative design approach
