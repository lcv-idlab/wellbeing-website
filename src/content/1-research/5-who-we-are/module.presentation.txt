    Part of the Department for Environment Constructions and Design, LCV is a space for applied research into the practices and socio-cultural meanings of visual culture and interactive media. In a context of transforming media communication and interfaces culture, we study the application, processes and methods of interactive technologies. We contextualise emerging practices critically reflecting on the user experiences, behaviours, aesthetics and impacts. LCV researches and develops educational models to explore the convergence of technology and design via prototyping and to promote the integration of bottom-up innovation models and community-driven approaches in design and education.

    The Department of Business Economics, Health and Social Care (DEASS) was created in 2014 from the fusion of the Department of Health (DSAN) and the Department of Business and Social Sciences (DSAS). Integrating three sectors (business economics, social and health care) under one roof allowed the Department to set itself the objective of tackling the complex problems of today’s world more effectively, implementing a range of competences that vary in terms of subject area but that have historically displayed a natural tendency toward integration.
