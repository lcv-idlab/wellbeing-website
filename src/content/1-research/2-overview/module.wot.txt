This source involves the practitioners' ways of approaching and handling performance anxiety, the use of mindful sources and bodywork activities and other sources of good habits effects. Since it has developed by years of practice and despite of more formalized system of psychological approaches, humans intrinsic ability of stress survival has demonstrated its function to be more sustainable and effective in a long term than outsider intervention and institutions."

    The problem is the lack of resources
    that performing artists have in
    sustaining good health and wellbeing and
    the gap in educational sectors in
    providing effective motivational
    strategies. Training the new performers
    and next generation in the ways of
    self-care and stress consciousness was
    usually done under the oversight of
    community members and the teacher.
    Following this storytelling tradition,
    stories by professional musicians and
    actors can create a fruitful
    social-learning environment and help the
    new generations of performers to care of
    their emotional health and to improve
    their lifestyle by enhancing their
    skills in anxiety management.

As output of the research the Open Access Toolkit provides an aid to help people explore their own thinking and relationship with behaviours that make them healthy, happy and efficient.</big>'

    form of personalized lifestyle
