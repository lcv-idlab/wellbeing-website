  text: >
    The main aim of the TELMI project is to
    study how we learn musical instruments,
    taking the violin as a case study, from
    a pedagogical and scientific perspective
    and to create new interactive,
    assistive, self-learning,
    augmented-feedback, and social-aware
    systems complementary to traditional
    teaching.
